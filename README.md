# Travel App

## Overview
 
This project requires you to build out a travel app that, obtains a desired trip location & date from the user,
and displays weather and an image of the location using information obtained from external APIs.
Finally, this is all going to be done in a Webpack environment, using an express server, 
and wrapped up with service workers.

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `index.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Dependencies

In this project we have several dependencies to start the server. We use express, cors and body-parser.
Allso we use webpack and weppack-cli to bundle the project. 

## Installation

* clone from GitHub the directory
* run npm install or npm i to install dependencies
* run npm start-prod to start up the server
* now you can open the web page on localhost:8000
